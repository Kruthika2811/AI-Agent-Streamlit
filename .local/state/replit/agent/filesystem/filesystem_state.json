The assistant listens for wake words, processes spoken commands, and responds using text-to-speech. It supports various functionalities including time/date queries, Wikipedia searches, web browsing, and basic conversational interactions.\n\n**Recent Addition (August 2025):** Added a modern web interface that allows users to interact with the voice assistant through a chat-style web application, making it accessible without requiring microphone hardware.\n\n# User Preferences\n\nPreferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.\n\n# System Architecture\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:\n\n**Main Controller (`main.py`)**\n- Entry point that orchestrates all components\n- Manages the main listening loop and wake word detection\n- Handles application lifecycle and error recovery\n\n**Web Interface (`web_app.py`)**\n- Flask-based web application providing chat-style interface\n- Real-time message processing with AJAX\n- Mobile-responsive design with quick command buttons\n- Conversation history and clear functionality\n\n**Speech Recognition (`speech_handler.py`)**\n- Uses the `speech_recognition` library for audio input processing\n- Implements ambient noise adjustment for better accuracy\n- Configurable timeout and phrase limits for responsive interaction\n\n**Text-to-Speech (`tts_handler.py`)**\n- Powered by `pyttsx3` for cross-platform speech synthesis\n- Supports voice customization (prefers female voices)\n- Implements queued speech processing to prevent overlapping audio\n\n**Command Processing (`command_processor.py`)**\n- Pattern-based command recognition using regular expressions\n- Modular command handlers for different functionality types\n- Extensible architecture for adding new command categories\n\n**Configuration Management (`config.py`)**\n- Centralized configuration for wake words, exit commands, and system settings\n- Website shortcuts for easy voice-controlled web browsing\n- Tunable parameters for speech recognition and TTS\n\n## Design Patterns\n\n**Command Pattern**: Each voice command type has dedicated handlers that can be easily extended or modified.\n\n**Observer Pattern**: The main loop continuously listens for wake words and triggers appropriate responses.\n\n**Configuration Pattern**: All system settings are externalized to a single configuration file for easy customization.\n\n## Threading Model\n\nThe application uses threading to handle concurrent operations:\n- Main thread manages the wake word listening loop\n- TTS operations run in separate threads to prevent blocking\n- Speech recognition operates synchronously within the main flow\n\n# External Dependencies\n\n## Core Libraries\n- **speech_recognition**: Primary library for converting speech to text\n- **pyttsx3**: Cross-platform text-to-speech synthesis engine\n- **wikipedia**: API integration for knowledge queries and summaries\n\n## System Dependencies\n- **Microphone access**: Requires system microphone permissions\n- **Audio output**: Needs functioning speakers or headphones for TTS\n- **Internet connectivity**: Required for Wikipedia searches and web browsing commands\n\n## Optional Integrations\n- **Web browser**: Uses system default browser for web navigation commands\n- **Operating system services**: Leverages OS-level audio and hardware interfaces\n\nThe application is designed to be lightweight and self-contained, with minimal external service dependencies beyond the core Python libraries.","size_bytes":3568},"test_assistant.py":{"content":"#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nTest script to demonstrate the voice assistant functionality\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom voice_assistant.command_processor import CommandProcessor\nfrom voice_assistant.tts_handler import TTSHandler\n\ndef test_voice_assistant():\n    \"\"\"Test the voice assistant with sample commands\"\"\"\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n    print(\"TESTING VOICE ASSISTANT FUNCTIONALITY\")\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n    \n    try:\n        # Initialize components\n        print(\"Initializing TTS handler...\")\n        tts = TTSHandler()\n        \n        print(\"Initializing command processor...\")\n        processor = CommandProcessor(tts)\n        \n        # Test commands\n        test_commands = [\n            \"what time is it\",\n            \"what date is it\",\n            \"search wikipedia for artificial intelligence\",\n            \"open google\",\n            \"hello\",\n            \"help\"\n        ]\n        \n        print(\"\\nTesting commands:\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        \n        for i, command in enumerate(test_commands, 1):\n            print(f\"\\n{i}.
